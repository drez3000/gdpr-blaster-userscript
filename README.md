# GDPR Blaster UserScript

## Overview

GDPR Blaster is a userscript designed to detect and remove GDPR and cookie consent dialogs from web pages without accepting or denying them.

## Features

- Detects and Removes: Automatically identifies and removes cookie consent dialogs.
- Non-Intrusive: Does not interact with consent optionsâ€”just removes the dialogs.
- Broad Compatibility: Works on (almost) any website due to its generic matching patterns.

## How it works

GDPR Blaster works with a wide range of GDPR consent solutions by combining explicit rules and generic pattern matching euristics.
It's optimized for the English and Italian languages, but works pretty well on other languages too.
